Window,

N=5

start size = 1
End size = 5

Scenarios

1. Client buffers 5 packets
2. Client sends first 5 packets and waits for acknowledgement(timer implementation)
3. If ack for packet 1 is received, client increments window by 1(Loop)
4. Client sends the new packet.
5. If packet 2 is lost(Timer expires) client sends all packets in the window.





Packet formation
Rules
Maximum segment size + header < 536


Header includes
Sequence number 16 bits
Checksum 16 bits
Data - MSS

1. Get the MSS from cmdline
2. choose MSS amount of data from buffer(Compute offset)
3. Send current sequence number and data to packet formation class.
4. Add sequence number to header
5. Use data to compute checksum and add it to header
6. Append header and data and make the packet.
7. Send packet to send() method.
